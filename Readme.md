# Unity.iOS.Extensions.XCode (.NETCORE Port)

For our internal tooling we need more capabilities from the Unity's XCODE API and we need the module to be .NETCORE 2.0 compliant.

This project does just that. 

## Usage 
Additional methods are listed bellow, and are rather self explanatory.

* PBXProject::GetUsedFrameworks()
* PBXProject::GetFilesIncludedInBuild()
* PBXProject::GetBuildProperties()
